A menu bar with both file and view menus:
File-New: create a new drawing. The drawing will always fit the canvas when it is created.
File-Load: load a drawing from a file (i.e. a file that previously saved, which replaces the current drawing).
File-Save: save the current drawing.

When try to draw a shape, first click to begin drawing, second click finish drawing.

A tool palette on the left-hand side, supporting the following tools:
A selection tool: this allows the user to select a shape that has been drawn. To select a shape, the user should click this tool, then click on an existing shape. Pressing ESC on the keyboard will clear shape selection. Selecting a shape will cause the color palette and line thickness palette to update their state to reflect the currently selected shape. Changing color or line thickness when a shape is selected will update the shape properties to the new values.
An erase tool: click on this tool and then click on a shape to delete it.
A line drawing tool: select this to draw a line (using the selected color and the line thickness).
A circle drawing tool: select this to draw an unfilled circle at the point indicated (using the selected line thickness and color for the border).
A rectangle tool: select this to draw an unfilled rectangle (using the selected line thickness and color for the border).
A fill tool: select this tool, and click on a shape to fill that shape with the currently selected color.

A line thickness palette: a graphical display of at least 3 line widths that the user can select. Selecting a line width will set the border thickness for any new shapes drawn. Selecting a shape will change the border thickness to reflect the line thickness of that shape.
